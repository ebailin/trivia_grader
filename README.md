For quickly marking trivia answers written in google spreadsheets

I wrote for this for a friend's trivia game nights. He was good with Google Spreadsheets and tableau, but had no coding background. After waiting for what felt like forever one night, I decided to write this so that we could hear if our team won (or, more often, how badly we lost) faster. This was the result.

I wrote it in about an hour, if that, but it did cut down the time it took to grade 10+ trivia teams' answers from at least 20 minutes to about 8, on average (we timed it). He ended up needing it to be in python2, so I had to translate it, but I did keep the original python 3. I've included the actual output from a few games. I have not, however, shared the json containing the credentials. While the google project was just used for this task and he stopped holding trivia nights (sadly, really), it doesn't sit right for me to give it out. If you would like to run the script, I'd prefer to share it directly.
